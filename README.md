## About me :writing_hand:

Hey there! I’m Marc a data analyst/engineer who likes making sense of the chaos. I enjoy building pipelines, dashboards, 
and tools that actually help people understand what’s going on. I lean on SQL, Python, and Power BI to turn raw data
into something clear, honest, and useful. I care about good design, clean logic, and telling the real story behind the numbers.
